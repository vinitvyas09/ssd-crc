        Stakeholder Insights for KC Can Compost
        This memo synthesizes insights from 57 stakeholder interviews conducted for the KC Can
Compost capstone project. Engaging with kiosk users, municipal representatives, trash
collectors, and KC Can Compost staff, I analyzed stakeholder needs, challenges, and
expectations to ensure our project aligns with real-world feedback. Initially focused on
developing an intermediary software system to connect the KC Can Compost app with its
kiosks, our approach evolved as stakeholder insights highlighted the need for a broader focus.
As a result, we pivoted mid-project to incorporate kiosk design, market analysis, financial
planning, and operational strategy, ensuring our solutions addressed the most pressing
concerns.
These interviews revealed that accessibility, community engagement, and education about
composting were more critical to stakeholders than app functionality, challenging our initial
assumptions. Based on these insights, this memo outlines key findings and presents strategic
recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of KC Can Compost’s initiative. The research
process has deepened my understanding of composting challenges and informed actionable
steps to ensure the project is practical, sustainable, and community-driven.
1. To Extract and Analyze Insights:
A. Deep Insights into Stakeholder Needs, Preferences, Challenges, and Expectations
Over the course of 57 stakeholder interviews, I engaged with a diverse group:
Throughout the course of conducting 57 stakeholder interviews, I carefully engaged with a
diverse range of individuals who interact with composting in different ways. These stakeholders
provided a wealth of perspectives, allowing me to assess the real-world challenges and
expectations surrounding composting kiosks. The interviews were designed to extract not only
surface-level feedback but also deeper insights into their motivations, hesitations, and
suggested improvements.
The stakeholders I interviewed can be broadly categorized into the following
- Community Members/Customers – These individuals are potential users of the composting
kiosks, and their insights provided an understanding of general attitudes towards composting,
ease of use, accessibility issues, and expectations from a public composting system. Many of
them had varying levels of familiarity with composting, from experienced participants to those
entirely new to the process.
- Trash Collectors – These professionals are responsible for transporting compostable waste
from the kiosks to KC Can Compost facilities. Their perspectives helped identify operational
challenges such as bin contamination, efficiency in waste collection, and the ergonomics of
handling kiosk waste.
- Municipal Representatives – These officials oversee local waste management policies and
play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of deploying composting kiosks. Their insights
helped assess the regulatory environment, potential partnerships, and the willingness of
municipalities to support composting infrastructure.
- KC Can Compost Staff and Business Partners – As key decision-makers shaping company
strategy and deployment logistics, their inputs provided clarity on how the company’s goals and
resources have shifted over time, influencing the direction of the capstone project.
Key Positive Insights
- Awareness About Composting – A majority of interviewees expressed strong enthusiasm for
learning more about composting. Many acknowledged that they lacked adequate knowledge
about the specific benefits of composting or how it could be seamlessly integrated into their
daily waste disposal habits. This indicates an opportunity for targeted educational initiatives to
increase participation rates.
- Convenience of Locations – Accessibility and ease of access were dominant themes in the
interviews. Many participants stated that they would be more inclined to compost regularly if
kiosks were strategically placed near their homes, workplaces, grocery stores, or community
centers. Several individuals mentioned that a lack of convenient drop-off points is a major
deterrent.
- Community Impact – Many respondents appreciated the idea of composting as a collective,
community-driven effort. They believed that composting kiosks could create environmental
awareness within neighborhoods, improve waste management habits, and foster a shared
sense of responsibility. Some interviewees also mentioned that seeing others actively
composting would encourage them to do the same.
- Education – A significant number of participants noted that clear, accessible instructions on
proper composting practices would help reduce contamination. Many suggested that physical
signage at kiosks, community workshops, or even app-based guidance would be valuable tools
in addressing the knowledge gap around composting.
Key Negative Insights
- Accessibility Issues – Some individuals, particularly elderly community members, those
without personal vehicles, and individuals with disabilities, raised concerns about the difficulty of
transporting compostable waste to drop-off locations. These challenges highlight the need for
better kiosk placement and improved accessibility features.
- Contamination Concerns – One of the biggest challenges identified by both users and waste
collectors was the risk of non-compostable materials being mistakenly added to the bins.
Contamination significantly reduces the effectiveness of the composting process and adds to
the operational burden of KC Can Compost. Several stakeholders emphasized the need for
better visual cues, educational materials, and stricter enforcement measures to ensure
compliance.
- Odor & Hygiene – A frequently raised issue was the concern about bad odors and hygiene
around the kiosks, particularly during warmer months. This feedback suggests a need for design
modifications, such as better ventilation systems, deodorizing elements, and more frequent
waste collection schedules. Some respondents also worried about pests and general
cleanliness.
- Physical Strain – Several interviewees, particularly waste collectors and elderly users,
pointed out the physical effort required to lift and dump compostable waste into the kiosk. For
some, heavy lifting or bending over to use the bins was difficult, reinforcing the need for an
ergonomic, user-friendly kiosk design.
- Desire for Rewards – While most participants understood the environmental benefits of
composting, a large portion of interviewees stated that they would be more motivated to
participate if there were tangible incentives. These could include discounts on compost,
recognition within the community, or a rewards system integrated into an app.
Areas for Improvement & Unexpected Findings
- Education & Incentives – Many interviewees were genuinely interested in composting but
lacked proper knowledge on how to do it effectively. This reinforced the idea that an
education-first approach is necessary. Additionally, an incentive-driven model that rewards
consistent composters could boost participation. Integrating gamification or community
competitions into the app could make composting more engaging.
- Kiosk Design – The physical usability of kiosks emerged as a major concern. Based on
feedback, an improved design with a top-opening mechanism, color-coded labeling, and
ergonomic bin placement would be beneficial. Suggestions included foot-pedal operated lids
and sensor-based openings to minimize contamination risk.
- Apps vs. Accessibility – Initially, I hypothesized that a comprehensive app would be the
primary driver for user engagement, but interviews revealed that stakeholders care more about
accessibility and convenience. The app, while useful for tracking and education, should not
replace or overcomplicate the fundamental ease of composting.
- Mid-Project Pivot – At the outset, the main objective was to develop a software bridge that
would connect the KC Can Compost app to its kiosk system, making it seamless for users to
track their composting activity. However, as the company’s own priorities changed, my project
shifted towards kiosk design, market analysis, financial planning, and identifying operational
gaps. This shift was unexpected but necessary, as it aligned better with stakeholder needs and
business goals.
Another unexpected realization was that many community members were less concerned about
app functionality and more focused on physical infrastructure and education. While we initially
thought that users would prioritize the convenience of an app to track their composting activity,
the majority of stakeholders emphasized the importance of kiosk accessibility, maintenance, and
user-friendliness. This evolution in understanding led to a more holistic project approach where I
explored not just the technology aspect but also logistics, stakeholder engagement, and
long-term adoption strategies.
2. To Reflect on Learning and Evolution
A. Evolution of Interview Strategy and Stakeholder Perspectives:
Initial Hypothesis
When the project began, the primary goal was to create a middleman software solution that
would seamlessly integrate the KC Can Compost mobile app with the physical composting
kiosks. The initial assumption was that technology would be the most significant driver of
efficiency and adoption, and I expected stakeholders to prioritize features such as real-time
usage tracking, automated reminders, contamination alerts, and user communication within the
app. The hypothesis was that ease of use through technology would be the key concern for
users, and an intuitive app with robust features would ensure greater participation and lower
contamination rates.
Based on this hypothesis, my early interview questions were structured around app usability,
digital engagement, and ways to simplify the composting process through automation. The
expectation was that stakeholders—ranging from individual composters to city officials—would
emphasize a need for a highly interactive and data-driven mobile experience that could provide
insights into waste diversion rates and personal contributions to environmental sustainability.
Mid-Stream Pivot
As the semester progressed, it became evident that KC Can Compost was shifting its priorities.
The company was moving away from a purely software-driven approach and was instead
focusing on kiosk manufacturing, market viability, and community-driven engagement. This
change altered the fundamental requirements of the project. Rather than just focusing on the
app as a bridge between users and kiosks, the company needed broader insights on how to
make the entire composting experience more effective and accessible—from physical design to
operational logistics.
Recognizing this shift, I had to broaden my interview approach significantly. Instead of focusing
solely on app users and their digital needs, I expanded the scope to include:
-
-
-
-
Local municipalities to understand the regulatory and policy challenges of deploying
composting kiosks in different neighborhoods.
Kiosk users gather first-hand experiences on barriers to participation, particularly
regarding accessibility, cleanliness, and convenience.
Waste collection teams to understand the operational difficulties and inefficiencies in the
current compost pickup system.
Community leaders and environmental organizations to assess public interest in
composting education and community-based incentives.
By shifting the interview focus, I was able to collect a much more holistic dataset that not only
included technological needs but also uncovered challenges related to physical infrastructure,
community behavior, municipal regulations, and waste logistics. This realignment ensured that
my findings remained relevant to the company’s evolving goals.
Impact of Empathy and Active Listening
The change in strategy allowed me to adopt a more empathetic and human-centered approach
to stakeholder interviews. Initially, I was focused on functional questions about how people
would use an app, but as I engaged with different groups, I realized that the biggest pain points
were not necessarily technology-related but rather linked to accessibility, physical constraints,
community engagement, and education.
For example, I spoke with a senior citizen who mentioned that she was eager to compost but
struggled to lift and carry her composting materials to a kiosk that was too high. Similarly, a
waste collection worker shared how improper bin design often led to spillage, creating hygiene
and contamination issues that increased their workload. These were critical, real-world concerns
that an app alone could not address.
By truly listening to these stories and experiences, I refined my interview questions to uncover
deeper motivations and pain points. Instead of simply asking about what digital features users
wanted, I started exploring:
What prevents people from composting in the first place?
What makes composting inconvenient, confusing, or difficult for different demographics?
How could physical design and placement of kiosks lower participation barriers?
What role do incentives, community programs, and education play in long-term
composting habits?
This approach fundamentally reshaped the project. Rather than simply optimizing how users
interact with the app, I was able to reorient the solution to address the full composting
experience—including physical kiosk accessibility, waste collection efficiency, and educational
outreach. It became clear that technology alone would not solve the participation challenges;
instead, a multi-faceted approach combining physical design, behavioral incentives, and
community engagement was required.

B. Instances Where Feedback Led to Significant Shifts
Design Priority Over Technology
One of the biggest revelations from stakeholder interviews was that physical accessibility, kiosk
cleanliness, and convenient locations were significantly more important to users than having
advanced app features. Initially, I assumed that a highly interactive app would be the key to
encouraging composting behavior, but users repeatedly expressed that what really mattered
was:
-
-
-
Easier access to kiosks—some were too far away or not placed in convenient locations.
Improved kiosk design—many mentioned that existing models were difficult to use,
especially for older adults or individuals with limited mobility.
Hygiene concerns—worries about odor, pests, and spillage were far more pressing than
whether the app had a progress tracker.
This insight led to a major restructuring of project priorities. Instead of focusing primarily on app
optimization, we shifted our recommendations toward improving kiosk design, strategic
placement, and sanitation measures to increase adoption rates.
Educational Emphasis
Another unexpected finding was the high demand for composting education. Many interviewees
said they were interested in composting but felt unsure about what materials were compostable,
how contamination works, and why composting benefits the environment. Some were worried
about doing it incorrectly, while others felt that there was a lack of clear guidance at the kiosks
themselves.
Initially, I assumed that composting education was secondary and that most people using the
kiosks already understood composting basics. However, interview feedback showed that lack of
knowledge was a major barrier to participation. In response, my recommendations shifted
toward:
-
-
-
Better kiosk signage with simple, visual instructions to reduce contamination.
Community workshops and engagement initiatives to educate first-time composters.
An educational component within the app that provides quick, easy-to-understand
guidance.
By integrating education more prominently into the project strategy, we could improve overall
participation rates and reduce contamination, ensuring that composting kiosks function more
effectively.
Incentive Structures
Another area where stakeholder feedback significantly influenced the project was in the role of
rewards and incentives. Before conducting interviews, I assumed that people composed
primarily out of environmental responsibility and would not need additional motivation. However,
interviews revealed that:
-
Many users felt that some form of recognition or reward would encourage them to
compost more consistently.
-
Some participants suggested that gamification (badges, leaderboards, or points) would
make the process more engaging.
Others recommended financial incentives or discounts at local stores for frequent composters.
This insight directly shaped my recommendations for integrating a lightweight rewards system
into the app and kiosk program. Instead of just tracking waste diversion data, the app could
include a simple gamified structure where users earn points, badges, or small discounts at
eco-friendly businesses. This approach aligns with behavioral psychology principles—rewarding
positive behavior increases long-term engagement—and ensures that composting becomes a
habit rather than just an occasional activity.
3. To Reflect on Interview Outcomes
A. Assessing the Effectiveness of the Interview Plan:
One of the most critical aspects of this stakeholder engagement process was evaluating how
effective the interview plan was in capturing meaningful insights that could directly influence the
project. By conducting 57 stakeholder interviews, I ensured that diverse perspectives were
considered and that findings were robust enough to inform strategic recommendations.
Throughout this process, I made multiple adjustments to refine my approach and maximize the
depth of data collection.
Strengths:
- Diverse Participants: The interviews were intentionally conducted across various stakeholder
groups, including community members who might use the compost kiosks, trash collectors
responsible for transportation, municipal representatives managing waste policies, and KC Can
Compost staff involved in strategic decision-making. This broad outreach provided a holistic
understanding of stakeholder needs, challenges, and expectations. Capturing insights from
different roles within the composting ecosystem enabled me to validate patterns in user
behavior, logistical constraints, and market demand.
- Responsive Iteration: The interview strategy was not static but evolved dynamically based on
real-time insights. Initially, the focus was on understanding how stakeholders would interact with
a mobile app for managing compost deposits, but as KC Can Compost pivoted towards kiosk
manufacturing and deployment, I adjusted the interviews accordingly. This mid-semester shift
allowed me to refine the questions to address more tangible concerns, such as kiosk
accessibility, contamination issues, and logistical feasibility. Adapting in real-time ensured that
every new interview contributed directly to refining the project's direction rather than collecting
outdated or irrelevant data.
Weaknesses/What Could Have Been Better:
- Earlier Prototyping: While the interviews were thorough, a key limitation was the lack of a
physical kiosk prototype early in the process. Many interviewees provided theoretical feedback,
but more specific insights could have been gained if they had interacted with an actual model.
Having even a basic prototype or a visual representation would have allowed stakeholders to
provide direct input on ergonomics, functionality, and design feasibility, resulting in a more
user-informed kiosk iteration.
- Segmented Approach: Although I engaged various stakeholder groups, a more structured
segmentation at the outset could have yielded even more tailored responses. For example,
targeting senior citizens separately from younger, tech-savvy users could have clarified
accessibility needs more distinctly. Likewise, interviewing more representatives from local
businesses or environmental advocacy groups might have uncovered additional partnership
opportunities for incentivizing composting. If I were to redo this process, I would create
segmented interview templates to extract more role-specific insights rather than using a
one-size-fits-all approach.
B. Sufficiency of Data & Additional Engagement Needs
The interview process generated a significant amount of qualitative data, covering multiple
dimensions of composting behaviors, infrastructure challenges, and municipal engagement.
However, while the information gathered was rich and insightful, there are areas where further
engagement could strengthen the project's outcomes.
- Sufficient Data Collected: The data gathered from interviews provided strong validation of core
concerns such as odor control, contamination risks, convenience of kiosk locations, and the role
of incentives in user participation. Across multiple stakeholder categories, common themes
emerged, reinforcing the reliability of these insights. Additionally, the unexpected findings about
the prioritization of education and community engagement over technology were highly
informative, leading to strategic pivots within the project. Given that the interview pool covered
multiple perspectives, the current dataset is comprehensive enough to drive well-informed
design and operational decisions.
- Further Engagement Opportunities: While the sample size and diversity of interviewees were
sufficient for broad insights, there are still some gaps in understanding specific stakeholder
needs:
- Special Needs and Mobility-Challenged Individuals: While accessibility issues were a
recurring theme, direct engagement with individuals who face mobility challenges (e.g.,
wheelchair users, elderly individuals) could offer first-hand insights into ergonomic
improvements for kiosk design. Conducting targeted interviews or user testing with this
demographic could ensure that universal design principles are incorporated.
- Schools & Local Businesses: Composting adoption can be accelerated through
institutional partnerships. Engaging schools could provide insights into how educational
programs can drive youth participation, while local businesses (restaurants, grocery
stores, cafés) could offer perspectives on large-scale compost waste disposal and
whether incentives like discounts or recognition programs would encourage participation.
Expanding interviews to these groups would solidify buy-in from influential community
stakeholders.
C. Implications for the Capstone Project:
The insights derived from the interviews have played a direct role in shaping the next steps of
the capstone project, leading to strategic pivots and refinements in project execution. Based on
stakeholder feedback, the project has shifted from purely a digital app focus to a comprehensive
strategy that includes kiosk design, market deployment, and operational planning. The following
are the key areas that will be emphasized moving forward:
Design Focus
- The top-loading kiosk design was repeatedly suggested by stakeholders as a solution to both
contamination and physical strain issues. Implementing this feature will make it easier for users
to dispose of compostable waste while preventing improper materials from being added.
- Odor mitigation strategies need to be an integral part of the kiosk design, incorporating
ventilation systems or odor-neutralizing filters. Given that odor was one of the most cited
concerns, proactive measures will be necessary to ensure user satisfaction.
- Clear and visible labeling is crucial to prevent contamination. The interviews revealed that
many users are unsure about composting rules, leading to accidental misplacements of waste.
Using color-coded labels, visual diagrams, and multilingual signage will make it easier for
diverse user groups to properly utilize the kiosks.
Educational Programs
- There is a strong demand for educational initiatives to complement the kiosk deployment.
Stakeholders expressed the need for community workshops, informational posters, and easily
accessible online resources to help new users understand the benefits of composting and how
to do it correctly.
- Schools should be actively involved in composting education, as younger generations can help
influence household composting behavior. A curriculum or hands-on composting program could
be developed in collaboration with local educators and environmental organizations.
- A simplified app or website component should be developed, not as the main product, but as a
supporting tool that provides basic composting tips, kiosk locations, and possible reward
tracking.
Strategic Partnerships
- Municipalities: Engaging with city governments is critical for securing kiosk placement
approvals, waste pick-up coordination, and potential funding opportunities. The project will focus
on establishing direct collaboration with waste management authorities to ensure smooth
integration into existing systems.
- Waste Management Agencies: Interviews with trash collectors provided insight into how to
optimize kiosk servicing schedules to prevent overflow and maintain hygiene standards. A
data-driven monitoring system (e.g., sensors that notify when a bin is full) could be explored as
part of operational planning.
- Local Businesses: There is potential to incentivize composting through partnerships with cafés,
restaurants, and grocery stores. Offering discounts or loyalty rewards in exchange for
responsible composting could drive greater participation. A pilot collaboration with a few
businesses would provide data on the effectiveness of these incentives before scaling up the
approach.
4. To Develop Strategic Recommendations
A. Actionable Recommendations Addressing Real-World Problems:
Through an in-depth analysis of 57 stakeholder interviews, I have identified several critical areas
of improvement that are directly applicable to KC Can Compost’s kiosk design, community
outreach, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability. These recommendations are not
just theoretical but are grounded in real stakeholder feedback, practical challenges observed in
the field, and iterative improvements based on data collection. Each recommendation aligns
with the core insights gathered and has been structured to provide a clear, actionable roadmap
for enhancing the project’s success.
1. Kiosk Design & Deployment
One of the most crucial aspects identified through stakeholder interviews is the physical
usability of the compost kiosks. Many users expressed concerns regarding ease of use,
contamination risks, and physical strain, especially for individuals who may have mobility
challenges or limited experience with composting.
Top-Opening Design:
- Stakeholders frequently mentioned that the current kiosk openings cause physical strain,
particularly when depositing compostable materials from heavier bins. To address this, a
top-opening mechanism is recommended, ensuring users do not have to bend excessively or
struggle with awkward angles.
- This design will also help minimize contamination, as users will be able to directly see where
they are placing their waste.
- To tackle hygiene concerns, integrating carbon filters or natural deodorizers into the kiosk
structure would help neutralize odors and improve overall cleanliness.
User-Centered Accessibility:
- Many stakeholders highlighted that the height and placement of the kiosks should cater to a
wider range of users, including individuals in wheelchairs, elderly citizens, and children who may
want to contribute.
- It is recommended that kiosks be placed in well-lit, safe areas that are easily accessible,
reducing barriers to composting participation.
- Adding a foot-pedal or sensor-based mechanism could provide a hands-free deposit option,
making the process more hygienic and inclusive.
Clear Visual Guides:
- One of the most common concerns from stakeholders was the lack of clarity regarding
composting rules. Many participants were uncertain about what could be composted, leading to
higher contamination rates.
- Implementing large, easy-to-read signage with icons, color coding, and step-by-step
instructions will improve user compliance and decrease mistakes.
- These signs should be placed directly on kiosks, near public areas like farmers' markets, and
in partner locations like grocery stores or schools to reinforce composting best practices.
2. Educational Initiatives
While many stakeholders supported the idea of composting, they lacked the necessary
knowledge about its process, benefits, and correct methods. To ensure sustained engagement
and compliance, a robust educational framework must be integrated into KC Can Compost’s
initiative.
Multi-Channel Awareness Campaign:
- Information should not be restricted to just the kiosks. A diverse communication strategy
should include:
- Posters and signage at kiosk sites explaining proper composting methods.
- Short social media videos demonstrating what should and should not be composted.
- Infographics shared via community newsletters or posted in local stores, farmers’
markets, and community boards.
- A QR code system on kiosks could direct users to a quick 1-minute tutorial video, improving
their understanding without overwhelming them with text.
Community Workshops & School Partnerships:
- Many stakeholders, especially families, showed interest in learning about composting together.
- Hosting monthly workshops at local libraries, community centers, or farmers’ markets could
drive higher participation rates.
- Partnering with local schools to introduce composting programs in classrooms would create
early awareness among students, leading to long-term behavioral change.
App Integration:
- While accessibility concerns made it clear that an app should not be the only focus, it can still
serve as a secondary engagement tool.
- The app should be simple and focused, providing users with:
- Kiosk location searches to find the nearest composting station.
- Quick guides and FAQs on what can and cannot be composted.
- A reward tracking system to gamify participation (explained further in the next section).
3. Incentives & Rewards
Although composting is an environmentally responsible act, stakeholders expressed a strong
interest in tangible incentives to make participation more consistent and rewarding.
Gamification & Digital Engagement:
- Implementing a digital badge system where users earn recognition for frequent composting
would provide motivation.
- A community leaderboard could showcase top composters in a neighborhood, encouraging a
friendly competition that aligns with sustainability goals.
- Challenges and streak rewards (e.g., compost 10 times in a month to earn a free community
compost bag) could increase habitual participation.
Partnership-Based Incentives:
- Forming partnerships with local businesses (grocery stores, coffee shops, garden centers) to
offer discounts or loyalty points for frequent composters.
- For example, users could scan a QR code after using the kiosk and earn discounts on fresh
produce or compostable products.
- These incentives not only encourage regular composting but also promote local businesses,
creating a win-win scenario.
4. Operational Considerations
For KC Can Compost’s kiosks to be successful and scalable, strategic planning and logistics are
essential. Many stakeholders highlighted concerns about maintenance, overflow, and municipal
coordination, which need to be addressed systematically.
Municipal Coordination:
- City officials should be engaged early in the process to ensure proper permit approvals, zoning
compliance, and potential funding opportunities.
- A well-documented proposal outlining environmental benefits, waste reduction impact, and
projected cost savings should be presented to secure municipal backing.
Waste Pick-Up Logistics:
- One of the most frequently mentioned concerns was overflowing bins, which could deter users
and create negative public perception.
- Implementing a weight or volume-based alert system (either sensor-based or manual
reporting) would notify waste collectors when bins are near capacity.
Coordination with waste collection services should ensure timely pickups, reducing the risk of
odors or hygiene issues.
Pilot Program Execution:
- A small-scale pilot rollout in three to five locations would allow KC Can Compost to:
- Measure actual usage rates and address unforeseen challenges before expanding.
- Test the effectiveness of educational materials and signage.
- Assess the impact of incentives and adjust the rewards system if necessary.
- A feedback loop should be created where pilot users can provide input, helping refine the kiosk
model and user experience before a larger launch.
5. Data & Measurement
Long-term success requires continuous improvement, driven by real user data and performance
tracking.
Usage Metrics Collection:
- Regularly track contamination rates, total compost collected per kiosk, and user participation
trends.
- Evaluate whether education initiatives have effectively reduced composting mistakes over
time.
Iterative Improvement Process:
- Conduct quarterly reviews based on data insights and stakeholder feedback.
- If certain locations show low engagement, conduct surveys to understand barriers and adjust
strategies accordingly.
- Ensure that every new change (design updates, educational programs, app features) is tested
and validated through stakeholder engagement.
Answers to Additional Reflection Questions
1. How did the findings from the interviews cause my hypotheses to change?
